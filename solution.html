    <h2 id="title">How to fight climate change?</h2>

     <p>
     As the proportion of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere rises, so does the temperature of Earth. Climatologists worry that the global temperature will increase so much that ice caps will begin melting within the next several decades. This would cause the sea level to rise. Coastal areas, including many low-lying islands, would be flooded. Severe climate change may bring more severe weather patterns—more hurricanes, typhoons, and tornadoes. More precipitation would fall in some places and far less in others. Regions where crops now grow could become deserts.

     As climates change, so do the habitats for living things. Animals that live in an area may become threatened. Many human societies depend on specific crops for food, clothing, and trade. If the climate of an area changes, the people who live there may no longer be able to grow the crops they depend on for survival. Some scientists worry that as the Earth warms, tropical diseases such as malaria, West Nile virus, and yellow fever will expand into more temperate regions.</p>
    <p>
     The temperature will continue to rise unless preventive steps are taken. Most climatologists agree that we must reduce the amount of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere. There are many ways to do this, including:
    <ul>
    <li>Drive less. Use public transportation, carpool, walk, or ride a bike.</li>
    <li>Fly less. Airplanes produce huge amounts of greenhouse gas emissions.</li>
    <li>Reduce, reuse, and recycle.</li>
    <li>Plant a tree. Trees absorb carbon dioxide, keeping it out of the atmosphere.</li>
    <li>Use less electricity.</li>
    <li>Eat less meat. Cows are one of the biggest methane producers.</li>
    <li>Support alternative energy sources that don’t burn fossil fuels, such as solar power and wind energy.</li>
    <li> Use less water. Most people in LA County use 123 gallons of water a day. Most families pay $51 per month for water. Use these tips to save water and money.</li>
    <li>Take showers instead of baths. A four-minute shower uses 20-40 gallons  of water. A bath uses more than double that amount of water.</li>
    <li>Turn off the water while you brush your teeth. You’ll save up to 200 gallons a month.</li>
    <li> Make sure your toilet works. Almost all high water bills are due to a leaky  or running toilet. Think about installing a water-saving toilet</li>
    <li>Use CFL (compact fluorescent light) or LED (light-emitting diode) bulbs. Both use at least 75% less energy than regular bulbs and last much longer. If 20 million light bulbs were changed to CFLs, we could all save more than $118 million in energy costs. It would also prevent releasing greenhouse gases.</li>
  </ul>

    The climate has changed many times during Earth’s history, but the changes have occurred slowly, over thousands of years. Only since the Industrial Revolution have human activities begun to influence climate—and scientists are still working to understand what the consequences might be.
