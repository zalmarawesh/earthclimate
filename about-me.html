      my favourite sport is kickbox and my favourite snack is chocolate,french fries.
      i build this website for earth Climate. earth is our home and it is our duty to protect and keep it clean. to have clean and safe live.
      climate change has a negative effects on the life of all living beings.
      rising temperatures,famines,forest fires ,floods,glaciers is one of the factors of climate change.
      also humans by cutting down forest,hunting animals,throwing garbage in water and building too many factories causes climate change.
      by creating this website i want to make people aware of climate change so that we can work together for a clean tomorrow.
      let's plant seedlings,factories should be built away from the city.
      factory sewage should not be thrown in to the water and avoid deforestation.
      to save ourselves and other living beings from the dangers of climate change.
